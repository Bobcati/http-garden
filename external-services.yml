# You can put external servers and transducers (e.g. CDNs) in this section.

# This is what an external server would look like:
# my-external-server:
#   x-props:
#     role: "server"
#     address: "1.2.3.4"

# And this is what an external transducer would look like:
# my-external-transducer:
#   x-props:
#     role: "transducer"
#     address: "4.3.2.1"
